# Getting Started With R

One of the main obstacles that many new R users face is simply getting started.

Some users struggle to figure out what the nuts and bolts of getting started: what do you need to download (wait, there’s R and RStudio?), where do you enter code, etc.

Others become overwhelmed, in a classic example of the paradox of choice, with all of the resources available online for learning R. How do you know which approach to using R (and there are many!) is best?

This presentation goes step-by-step, helping people understand what R is, what you need to download, and what it looks like to begin using it. This presentation uses a [Tidyverse-centric approach](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) that makes the learning process much easier (it’s also [favored by experienced users](https://twitter.com/rfortherest/status/1095375761660395520)).
